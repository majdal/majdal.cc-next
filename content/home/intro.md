Hello,

My name is Majd Al-shihabi.

I am a technologist, turned urban planner, turned technologisturbanplanner. I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the Geography and Planning department. Previously, I did my undergrad in systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo, in Canada. I also applied systems thinking to the city, when I did a master's degree in urban planning at the American University of Beirut. 

In 2018, I was the inaugural [Bassel Khartabil Free Culture Fellow](https://creativecommons.org/2018/04/15/fellowship-memorial-fund/), with the support of Creative Commons, Mozilla, and Wikimedia foundations. The fellowship enabled my journey with [Palestine Open Maps](https://palopenmaps.org), and a few other archival projects. 

You can reach me by email, or can follow me on Twitter, or view some of the code I wrote on GitHub or GitLab.
