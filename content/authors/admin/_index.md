I am a systems design engineer, which I studied that at the University of Waterloo, in Canada. I apply systems thinking to a number of fields. First is designing and implementing large projects for the Web. The other is urban planning, which I am currently studying at the American University of Beirut.

I am the inaugural [Bassel Khartabil Free Culture Fellow](https://creativecommons.org/2018/04/15/fellowship-memorial-fund/), and with the support of the fellowship, I work on [Palestine Open Maps](https://palopenmaps.org/), and the [Masrad:platform](https://masrad.org/) for archiving oral history.
